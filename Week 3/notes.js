// Hints for this next round of exercises:

/*
Use these methods:

- Number()
- parseInt()

Turn a number like this:
123

Into this:
100
20
3

(there are methods to do this)

Go back to the acronyms challenge and look at the ascii hint, see if you can check if things are lowercase letters and convert them to their ascii upper case values.
